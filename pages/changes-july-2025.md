# Upcoming changes for indigo-minior

Hi everyone,

This is edocsil, developer of the indigo-minior and yellow-minior bots, and moderator for Pokémon GO Ottawa for the past four years. Being part of the Pokémon GO Ottawa community has been an incredible journey. I've made some great friends, and I've had the pleasure of working alongside amazing people. I hope my contributions helped make your time on the server more enjoyable, even if much of it happened quietly behind the scenes.

I am writing this letter to let you all know that I'll be stepping down from the Pokémon GO Ottawa staff team, effective **Friday, July 11th**. Along with my departure, there will be significant changes to indigo-minior: all moderation features and all server-specific functions tailored for Pokemon GO Ottawa will be discontinued.

I am deeply greatful for the friendships and memories. I wish you all continued fun and success in life, and while playing this amazing game.

Thanks you for everything,

- **The raid quiz.**
- Recurring info messages, such as the Vivillon one in the `#friend-codes` channel.
- Usage tips for PokeNav prefix (`$`) commands.
- Responding to stickers with channel links.
- The type effectiveness quiz.

There are no planned changes for yellow-minior.
